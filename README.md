# DESCRIPTION
The home automation system is built around the ESP32 microcontroller, known for its built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities. This project utilizes the Bluetooth functionality of the ESP32 to communicate with a smartphone application or terminal, which sends control commands to operate connected devices.
A 4-channel relay module is used to control four appliances, each simulated in this project using LEDs. The LEDs represent the appliances being switched ON and OFF. The relay module acts as an intermediary between the low-power ESP32 and high-power appliances, ensuring safe operation without overloading the microcontroller.
